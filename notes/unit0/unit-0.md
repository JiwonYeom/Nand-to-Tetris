# Elements of a computer

- Machine language (low-level language) is also an abstraction.

> hardware architecture > chipsets > integrated package of *elementary logic gates* > arithmetic gates(**Nand / Nor**) > siwtching devices(transistors)

- Understanding these can make you a sophisticated developer!

- concept of abstraction : **WHAT** the entity does, and ignore **HOW**
    - AKA Interface, module
- Worry about a single level, and forget the already developed lower level.
