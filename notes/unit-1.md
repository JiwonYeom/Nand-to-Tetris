## Boolean Gates
- Physical implementation of Boolean function

#### Boolean Algebra
- Deals with Boolean(binary) values
- Binary input -> binary output
- *Truth table* representation

#### Boolean Expression
- And 
- Or 
- Not 

#### Canonical Representation
- Every Boolean function can be expressed by 
    1. Canonical Expression
    2. Can be expressed using And, Or, Not

#### Gate logic
- gate->physical device of Boolean function
- primitive gate

#### Primitive & Composite Gates
- gate logic ~ logic design ~ composite gates
- Any logic gate can be viewed from **external** or **internal** perspective
